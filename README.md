# PMAT-Course-Final

After recently completing the Practical Malware Analysis and Triage (PMAT) course from TCM Security, I was tasked with a final project that required analyzing any malware sample from the course, performing a detailed analysis, and creating detection rules using YARA.
For this final project, I chose to analyze the "SickoMode" sample. This custom malware, written in Nim, was an fun challenge to reverse engineer and analyze, providing me with valuable insights into its behavior and tactics.
